# Ai-powered-smart-glasses-for-the-visually-impaired

The AI-powered smart glasses for the blind is an assistive technology project designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their environment more independently. Built using Python and computer vision, the system uses a Raspberry Pi and a camera mounted on glasses to detect and recognize faces, objects, and text in real time. When the camera captures an image, the AI processes it using pre-trained models for facial recognition, object detection (YOLO), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text. The recognized information is then converted into speech using a text-to-speech engine, allowing users to hear what's in front of them through a connected speaker. Additionally it acts as their voice assistant and a companion who answers all the questions. At the same time it is also  This project provides a practical, wearable solution to enhance mobility and awareness for the visually impaired.
